# blur
This is a plugin for [chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) that blurs your wallpaper when you open an application or a window.

![Demonstration](demo.gif)

It currently does not support space-specific wallpapers;
all spaces will have the same wallpaper.

## Settings

Example: `chunkc set wallpaper ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg`

- `wallpaper` (string [path]): path to your wallpaper. Default: path to your current wallpaper.

- `wallpaper_blur` (float): changes the blur intensity. Default: `0.0` (imagemagick selects a suitable value when `0.0` is used).

- `wallpaper_mode` (`fill`, `fit`, `stretch` or `center`): the way a wallpaper is displayed. Default: `fill`.

- `wallpaper_tmp_path` (string [path]): where to store the blurred wallpaper. Default: `/tmp/`.

## Runtime commands
These commands can be used while chunkwm is running, whithout the need of reloading the plugin. The syntax is `chunkc blur::[command] [args]`.
Example: `chunkc blur::wallpaper ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg`

- `wallpaper` (string [path]): path to you wallpaper.
